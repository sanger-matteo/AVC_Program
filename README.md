This repository contains a collection of Matlab files, libraries of functions and drivers that provide the tools to create scripts to command an Automated Valve Controller.

## Description
This repository includes several scripts used in the study. Below is a brief overview of each:
- **AVC_code:** As an example, we include the code for controlling the microfluidic chip MS 7 [see Figure 1]. See the repository on [Microfluidc](https://github.com/sanger-matteo/Microdevices_Designs) to find the scheme and masks layout for this chip.
- **AVC_control_prog:** Microsoft Windows compatible drivers to control the valves.
- **AVC_lib:** set of (mostly) Matlab libraries and function that code for the most commond commands that would be used in an AVC. 
- **helper scripts**: some other example of control programs for the AVC for other microfluidic chips.
